Compiled languages are automatically prepared to run, a bit flexible and require compilation, while interpreted languages are cross-platform, easy to test, bugs are much easier to catch, an interpreter is required, their source code is publicly accessible and they are often slow.

# Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?
java is compiled and interpreted

It is solved by dividing the value by two, decimal values are not taken, only integer values, in the event that we get a decimal value, it means that we have 1 left over.

- 23 entre 2 = 11 -> 11*2 = 22 nos sobra 1 porque 23-22=1
- 11 entre 2 = 5 sobra 1
- 5 entre 2 = 2 sobra 1 
- 2 entre 2 = 1 sobra 0
- 1 entre 2 = 0 sobra 1

-- we order them from bottom to top
--- Result:  10111

- 12 entre 2 = 6 sobra 0
- 6 entre 2 = 3 sobra 0
- 3 entre 2 = 1 sobra 1
- 1 entre 2 = 0 sobra 1

-- we order them from bottom to top
--- Result:  1100

- 1991 entre 2 = 995 sobra 1
- 995 entre 2 = 497 sobra 1
- 497 entre 2 = 248 sobra 1
- 248 entre 2 = 124 sobra 0
- 124 entre 2 = 62 sobra 0
- 62 entre 2 = 31 sobra 0
- 31 entre 2 = 15 sobra 1
- 15 ente 2 = 7 sobra 1
- 7 entre 2 = 3 sobra 1
- 3 entre 2 = 1 sobra 1
- 1 entre 2 = 0 sobra 1

-- we order them from bottom to top
--- Result:  11111000111
