# REST API Clients

# Description

Because REST uses the client-server model for communication between two parties, it is important that you know what options are available
to you in order to interact with a REST API as a developer.

Please complete the following exercises:

  <ul>
  <li>Install Postman in your computer, follow  <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/installation-and-updates/"> this  </a> guide</li>
  <li>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VywxIQ2ZXw4"> this  </a> course about how to use Postman to interact with APIs</li>
   <li>Answer the questions: </li>
    <ul>
    <li>Postman only works with REST APIs?</li>
    <li>Is there an alternative to Postman?</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

## How to submit my solution?
