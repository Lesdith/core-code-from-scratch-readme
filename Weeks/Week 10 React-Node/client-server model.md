    <td>What is a Server?</td>
    <td>:satellite_antenna: A Server in the IT world is a remote computer that provides access to data and services. Servers are usually physical devices such as rack servers, though the rise of cloud computing has brought virtual servers into the equation. The server handles processes like e-mail, application hosting, Internet connections, printing, and more.</td>

    <td>What is a Client?</td>
    <td>:satellite_antenna: A Client is either a person or an organization using as a service. In the IT context, the client is a computer/device, also called a Host, that actually uses the service or accepts the information. Client devices include laptops, workstations, IoT devices, and similar network-friendly devices.</td>

    <td>Why do we refer to a certain class of applications as Servers?</td>    
    <td>:satellite_antenna:Usually are network computers that store and run an application for client computers, and their function, occupy a large chunk of computing territory between database servers and the end user.</td>

    <td>What is the difference?</td>   
    <td>:satellite_antenna:They may need to connect to other servers to acquire information or provide services.</td>
