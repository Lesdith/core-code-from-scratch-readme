    <td>What is an API?</td>    
    <td>:pushpin:An API or application programming interface is a set of definitions and protocols used to design and integrate application software.<br>    
      API is the acronym in English for "application programming interface", an intermediary software that allows applications to communicate with each other. Every time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, you're using an API.</td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
    <td>how do the APIs work?</td>
    <td>:pushpin:An API is a kind of bridge that connects various types of software or applications and can be created in various programming languages. In addition to good development, an API must have clear and objective documentation in order to facilitate its implementation. Node.js has had this ability for a long time, and there are a number of JavaScript libraries and frameworks that enable module usage.</td>

  <tr>
    <td> What is a Protocol?</td> 
    <td>:ballot_box_with_check:XML-RPC: allows the exchange of functions between networks. XML-RPC uses XML to describe responses/requests and HTTP protocols for transferring information from client to server.<br> 
        :ballot_box_with_check:JSON-RPC is a lightweight RPC similar to XML. Here the protocol is encoded in JSON; allows receiving calls to the server with asynchronous responses.<br>    
        :ballot_box_with_check:SOAP - A simple object access protocol for exchanging structured information when implementing web services on computer networks. SOAP uses XML for authentication, authorization, and process communication in operating systems. <br>

  <tr>
    <td>Is the term API only applicable to the communication of programs over the Internet?</td>
    <td>:pushpin:All web services are APIs, but not all APIs are web services.</br>
  REST API is a special type of web API that uses the standard architectural style explained above.</br>
  The different terms related to APIs, such as Java APIs or Service APIs, exist because historically APIs were created before the World Wide Web.</br> 
  Modern web APIs are REST APIs and the terms can be used interchangeably.<br>

    <td>Why is structured communication between two programs important?</td>
    <td>:pushpin:An application programming interface (API) is a piece of code that acts as an intermediary between two different pieces of software and enables them to communicate with each other.</br.
    Or in other words, it’s a user interface for software instead of a person.<br>

   <td>
     Do we humans use APIs when communicating without technology?
   </td>
  <td>
    :pushpin: Not because APIs allow the end user to use an application, software or even a simple spreadsheet, querying, changing and storing data from different systems, without the user having to access them directly.

  <tr> 
  <td>
    Is an API just another program or a standard?
  </td>
  <td>
    It is considered a type of web development architecture that is fully supported by the HTTP standard. Therefore it is not a protocol or a standard but rather a set of architectural limits.

  <tr>
  <td>
    Do you know any API? Can you list at least 5 examples of APIs?
